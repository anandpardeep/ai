# CROWDSTRIKE 2025 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT

General Secretary Xi Jinping’s 2014 call for China to become a cyber power (网络强国) and the CCP’s grand strategy of national rejuvenation (伟大复兴) have accelerated the sophistication of China’s cyber capabilities throughout the first quarter of the 21st century. The CCP’s decades of cyber program investments include:

- Expanding CCP oversight of information networks in China through a broad cybersecurity legal framework
- CCP investment in university systems that produce a highly trained and readily available cyber workforce
- Private sector contracting pipelines that provide skilled support and infrastructure to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), Ministry of Public Security (MPS), and Ministry of State Security (MSS) cyber units
- Vulnerability discovery, bug hunt, and domestic capture-the-flag competitions that foster Chinese cyber talent and feed CCP-controlled exploit development programs
- Industry networking through which MSS and PLA cyber operators increasingly share unique closed-access tooling and tradecraft

Highly likely as a result of these investments, China-nexus targeted intrusion operations are marked by increased OPSEC and specialization. Adversaries are pre-positioning themselves into critical networks and are supported by industry networking and larger ecosystems, which include shared tooling and training pipelines supplying them with sophisticated malware and tradecraft.
