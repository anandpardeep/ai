These statistics highlight the global reach of adversary operations and the necessity for cross-domain security strategies that account for identity compromise, lateral movement, and cloud-based attack vectors.

This shift toward malware-free attack techniques has been a defining trend over the past five years. In 2024, malware-free activity accounted for 79% of detections, a significant rise from 40% in 2019.

| Year | Percentage Malware-Free |
|------|------------------------|
| 2019 | 40%                   |
| 2020 | 51%                   |
| 2021 | 62%                   |
| 2022 | 71%                   |
| 2023 | 75%                   |
| 2024 | 79%                   |
