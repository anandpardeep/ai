# GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND THE ENTERPRISING ADVERSARY

GenAI has emerged as an attractive tool for adversaries with a low barrier to entry that makes it widely accessible. Recent advancements in genAI have enhanced the efficacy of certain cyber operations, particularly those using social engineering. It will almost certainly be employed in 2025 cyber operations.

Adversaries increasingly adopted genAI throughout 2024, particularly in support of social engineering efforts and high-tempo IO campaigns. Both were supported by genAI tools that can create highly convincing outputs without precise prompting, custom model training, or fine-tuning. Some threat actors are employing genAI, specifically LLMs, to support CNO efforts.

| - FAMOUS CHOLLIMA employed fictitious LinkedIn profiles with genAI-created text and fake profile images     | - Spam email campaign distributing *Snake Keylogger* likely used LLM-generated content                |
| - Deepfake video and voice clones enabled business email compromise (BEC) schemes                          | - Big game hunting (BGH) ransomware operators *APT INC* deployed likely LLM-authored data destruction script |
| - Studies validated effectiveness of genAI in phishing                                                     | - Likely LLM-generated decoy sites used in NITRO SPIDER campaigns                                    |
| - China-aligned, LLM-powered *Green Cicada* network posted coordinated inauthentic behavior on social media| - Actors on criminal forms discussed using LLMs for coding and shell commands                        |
| - Russia-aligned operators used LLMs to spread disinformation on social media                              | - LLM was likely used to develop an alleged exploit for CVE-2024-3400                                |
| - GenAI was used during Indian election season to create videos and images                                 | - Cloud-conscious operators attempted to gain access to enterprise LLMs                              |
