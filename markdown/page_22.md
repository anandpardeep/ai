# CROWDSTRIKE 2025 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT

---

FAMOUS CHOLLIMA’s cyber operations remained remarkably consistent throughout 2024, relying on delivery of a first-stage implant via a trojanized Node.js application. This application was disguised as a coding challenge for blockchain developers and delivered to victims under the guise of an employment interview. FAMOUS CHOLLIMA deployed seven distinct malware families in 2024, evading detection by slightly refining how the files were downloaded and executed.

FAMOUS CHOLLIMA’s malicious insiders appear to opportunistically pursue insider access across multiple sectors. The adversary’s activity is likely driven by available employment opportunities rather than specific targeting requirements.

Operatives use stolen or fraudulent identities to obtain software development jobs and then send their company-provided laptop to a third-party facilitator running a laptop farm. CrowdStrike OverWatch identified several laptop farms in Illinois, New York, Texas, and Florida. FAMOUS CHOLLIMA installs remote management tools and several browser extensions on the laptops. While CrowdStrike Intelligence has observed code or intellectual property exfiltration in some cases, most insider threats appear motivated by the job’s salary.

FAMOUS CHOLLIMA was one of the most active adversaries in 2024, significantly surpassing other state-nexus adversaries’ operational tempos. Notably, activity increased in the second half of 2024. This adversary will very likely continue conducting parallel cyber and insider threat campaigns well into 2025. This assessment is based on the adversary’s success, their ongoing high operational tempo, and the minimal impact of government indictments and actions against the adversary throughout 2024.

## Information Operations

Adversaries can easily employ genAI tools to conduct IO campaigns and primarily use them to create tailored content at scale. Unlike other social engineering techniques, IO campaigns using AI-generated content are typically not checked for accuracy by most consumers. Adversaries may achieve their goals even if the target knows the content is fabricated.

In August 2024, industry sources reported on *Green Cicada*, an IO network likely enabled by a Chinese-language LLM system comprising more than 5,000 inauthentic accounts on the social media platform X. This network amplified politically divisive issues to exacerbate social divisions in the lead-up to the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Industry sources have linked the operation to China-based entities using LLMs.

Russia-aligned operators also used genAI to spread disinformation. In 2024, a propagandist likely used LLMs to generate tailored content and workflow automation tools that supported a vast IO campaign targeting U.S. audiences. Multiple Russia-nexus IO campaigns — including those targeting Israel, the U.S., and various European countries — employed genAI to generate text and images throughout 2024.
