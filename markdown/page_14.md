# CROWDSTRIKE 2025 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT

## Impact and Connection to Ransomware

In this case, CURLY SPIDER was stopped by CrowdStrike OverWatch before they could proceed with the rest of their attack. However, CrowdStrike Intelligence has seen these tactics directly support ransomware operations, and this adversary frequently collaborates with [WANDERING SPIDER](#), the group behind Black Basta ransomware. By combining high-tempo social engineering, legitimate remote tools, and cloud-hosted payloads, CURLY SPIDER exemplifies how modern adversaries bypass traditional defenses and achieve rapid operational success.

## Proactive Defense Is Essential

Adversaries are refining their tactics to move faster and exploiting trusted access to bypass traditional defenses. The explosive growth in access broker activity, valid credential abuse, and interactive intrusions highlights the urgent need for organizations to adopt proactive security strategies that prevent, detect, and respond to these threats in real time.

**Security teams must:**

- ➤ Prioritize identity protection to prevent unauthorized access
- ➤ Harden cloud environments against credential abuse and address misconfigurations
- ➤ Accelerate response times to counter rapid breakout events
- ➤ Leverage AI-driven threat hunting to detect stealthy adversary movements
