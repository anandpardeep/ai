# The Growing Reliance on Identity Attacks and Vulnerability Exploits

Every breach starts with initial access, and identity-based attacks are among the most effective entry methods. Instead of traditional malware, adversaries favor faster and stealthier methods such as vishing, social engineering, access broker services, and trusted relationship abuse.

A major driver behind this shift is the rise of access brokers: specialists who acquire access to organizations and sell it to other threat actors, including ransomware operators. Access broker activity surged in 2024, with advertised accesses increasing by nearly 50% over 2023. Meanwhile, valid account abuse was responsible for 35% of cloud-related incidents, reflecting attackers’ growing focus on identity compromise as a gateway to broader enterprise environments.

But identity isn’t the only target — adversaries are also exploiting vulnerabilities to gain initial access. In 2024, 52% of observed vulnerabilities were linked to initial access, reinforcing the need to secure exposed systems before attackers establish a foothold.

As adversaries scale identity-based attacks and vulnerability exploitation, organizations must adopt proactive defense strategies, including identity verification, risk-based patching, and early detection of credential abuse, to disrupt adversary operations before they escalate.

# The Continued Rise of Interactive Intrusions

Modern cyber threats are increasingly dominated by “interactive intrusion” techniques, where adversaries execute hands-on-keyboard actions to achieve objectives. Unlike traditional malware attacks, these intrusions rely on human adversaries mimicking legitimate user or administrator behavior, making them exceptionally difficult to detect.

In 2024, CrowdStrike observed a 35% year-over-year increase in interactive intrusion campaigns. For the seventh consecutive year, the technology sector remained the most targeted industry, with high attack volumes also observed in consulting, manufacturing, and retail. The charts on the following page reflect the relative frequency of intrusions in the top geographical regions and industry verticals.
