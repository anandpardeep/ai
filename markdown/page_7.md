# CROWDSTRIKE 2025 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT

During 2024, CrowdStrike Intelligence introduced 26 newly named adversaries — including the new Kazakhstan-based adversary [COMRADE SAIGA](#) — raising the total number of named adversaries tracked across all motivations to 257.  
In addition to named adversaries, CrowdStrike Intelligence tracks more than 140 active malicious activity clusters and emerging threat groups.

In the past year, CrowdStrike has been working to enrich the in-platform Falcon experience by providing further insights from CrowdStrike's broad view into the changing threat landscape in different industries and regions. CrowdStrike ties these insights to activity occurring outside the customer perimeter by monitoring the criminal underground and emerging threats.

New dashboards provide insight into Falcon Adversary OverWatch threat hunting findings across CrowdStrike's customer ecosystem, while click-to-hunt capabilities enable seamless transition from new threat hunting query feeds to real-time investigations in [CrowdStrike Falcon® Next-Gen SIEM](#). Additionally, new Counter Adversary Playbooks make it easy to build comprehensive intelligence monitoring programs customized for any organization.

The CrowdStrike 2025 Global Threat Report summarizes the CrowdStrike Intelligence team's analysis performed throughout 2024 and describes notable themes, trends, and events across the cyber threat landscape. This annual report also includes anticipatory threat assessments to help prepare and protect organizations throughout the coming year.
