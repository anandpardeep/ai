# GenAI Outlook

More adversaries will likely use genAI to augment social engineering and CNO campaigns in 2025. This assessment is made with moderate confidence based on the growing availability and capability of genAI tools and adversaries’ increased experience with integrating them. CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses more technically capable threat actors will be best equipped to employ genAI tools, while less sophisticated threat actors will likely not fully exploit their capabilities.

### China’s Maturing Cyber Capabilities

China’s cyber espionage and intelligence collection capabilities reached an inflection point in 2024 relative to previous years. In addition to prolific and high-profile cyber espionage activities — which continued to increase across almost every sector that CrowdStrike Intelligence tracks — China-nexus adversaries and the larger ecosystem supporting their operations have matured in capability and capacity.

Throughout 2024, China-nexus adversaries’ advancements manifested through increasingly bold targeting, stealthier tactics, and specialized operations. The underlying motivation is likely China’s desire for regional influence in the nation’s near abroad. This includes a desire for the eventual reunification of Taiwan, which may ultimately bring China into conflict with the United States.

In addition to facilitating intelligence collection against foreign political and military entities, these operations likely fulfill general intelligence requirements in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s strategic plans. This includes the 14th Five-Year Plan, which highlights key sector and technology priorities. China-nexus adversaries also conduct intelligence collection against social and political movements perceived as domestic security threats in China. The CCP collectively refers to Falun Gong practitioners, Chinese democracy activists, Uyghur separatists, Tibetan separatists, and Taiwanese separatists as the “Five Poisons” and views these groups as a threat to its legitimacy and China’s overall stability.
