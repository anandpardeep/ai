# 4 Prioritize vulnerabilities with an adversary-centric approach

Adversaries are increasingly exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities and using exploit chaining, combining multiple vulnerabilities to gain rapid access, escalate privileges, and bypass defenses. These multi-stage attacks often rely on public resources like POC exploits and technical blogs, enabling adversaries to craft effective and hard-to-detect payloads.

To counter these threats, organizations must prioritize regular patching or upgrading of critical systems, especially frequently targeted internet-facing services like web servers and VPN gateways. Monitoring for subtle signs of exploit chaining, such as unexpected crashes or privilege escalation attempts, can help detect attacks before they progress.

Tools like Falcon Exposure Management, built with native AI prioritization, enable teams to reduce noise and focus on the vulnerabilities that matter most, specifically those affecting critical and high-risk systems. By adopting proactive security approaches, discovering exposures across the attack surface, and leveraging automation, organizations can mitigate sophisticated threats and limit adversary opportunities.

# 5 Know your adversary and be prepared

When a cyberattack unfolds in minutes — or even seconds — being prepared can be the difference between containment and catastrophe. An intelligence-driven approach enables security teams to move beyond reactive defense by understanding which adversary is targeting them, how they operate, and what their objectives are. With threat intelligence, adversary profiling, and tradecraft analysis, security teams can prioritize resources, adapt defenses, and actively hunt for threats before they escalate. CrowdStrike’s threat intelligence doesn’t just detect known threats — it anticipates new and evolving tradecraft, ensuring defenders are always one step ahead. By seamlessly integrating intelligence into security workflows, organizations can accelerate response times, disrupt adversaries, and turn intelligence into action.

Though technology is critical to detect and stop intrusions, the end user remains a crucial link in the chain to stop breaches. Organizations should initiate user awareness programs to combat the continued threat of phishing and related social engineering techniques. For security teams, practice makes perfect. Encourage an environment that routinely performs tabletop exercises and red/blue teaming to identify gaps and eliminate weaknesses in your cybersecurity practices and response.
