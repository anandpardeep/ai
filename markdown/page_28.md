# CROWDSTRIKE 2025 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT

## Specialized China-Nexus Adversaries

CrowdStrike Intelligence identified seven new targeted intrusion adversaries originating from China in 2024, five of which are unique in their specialization and sophistication. [**LIMINAL PANDA**](#), [**LOCKSMITH PANDA**](#), and [**OPERATOR PANDA**](#) are high-capability adversaries with unique telecom network targeting remits and toolsets; [**VAULT PANDA**](#) focuses on the financial services sector worldwide; and [**ENVOY PANDA**](#) is a previously low-capability adversary who has markedly increased their OPSEC posture. The emergence of adversaries with unique tactics, tradecraft, and target scopes represents an ongoing shift in China-nexus intrusions from so-called smash-and-grab operations to increasingly focused and mission-specific intrusions.

| Adversary         | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **LIMINAL PANDA** | Demonstrates extensive knowledge of telecommunications networks and uses compromised telecom infrastructure to move across regions |
| **LOCKSMITH PANDA** | Has targeted technology, gaming, energy, and telecommunications entities in Taiwan and Indonesia as well as Hong Kong democracy activists in operations likely intended to facilitate intelligence collection |
| **OPERATOR PANDA** | Has targeted telecom and professional services entities and relies heavily on exploiting internet-facing appliances (such as Cisco switches) for initial access |
| **VAULT PANDA** | Exploits web-facing applications to achieve initial access to victim networks and uses a combination of unique, shared, and publicly available tools in their intrusions; targets financial services, gambling, technology, academic, defense, and government entities likely to facilitate intelligence collection operations |
| **ENVOY PANDA** | Targets Africa- and Middle East-based government entities — particularly in the diplomatic space — and increasingly uses anonymization attempts in the operations |
