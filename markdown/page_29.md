# CROWDSTRIKE 2025 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT

## Adversaries Respond to Tracking and Disruption

Throughout 2024, China-nexus adversaries increasingly responded to ongoing government, law enforcement, and security researcher tracking and disruption efforts by redoubling their attempts to obfuscate operations. Multiple adversaries employed ORB networks consisting of hundreds or thousands of compromised devices to proxy and route their traffic during intrusion operations in an attempt to maintain anonymity. Despite law enforcement attempts to disrupt the ORB networks, China-nexus adversaries continue to use these resources as a key part of their operations. They also continue to share tools; for example, at least five distinct China-nexus adversaries are now using the once-unique malware _KEYPLUG_.

## CLOUD-CONSCIOUS  
## THREAT ACTORS CONTINUE  
## TO INNOVATE

In 2024, new and unattributed cloud intrusions increased 26% compared to 2023, indicating more threat actors seek to exploit cloud services. CrowdStrike observed more intrusions in which attackers gained initial access via valid accounts, leveraged cloud environment management tools for lateral movement, and abused cloud provider command line tools. Other cloud-conscious tactics — such as enumerating cloud infrastructure and identities and maintaining persistence via alternate authentication mechanisms — were consistent throughout 2024.

## New Cloud-Conscious Threat Actors Emerge in 2024

In 2023, prolific eCrime adversary SCATTERED SPIDER accounted for 30% of all cloud-based intrusions. This number fell to 13% in 2024, partly because numerous nation-state and opportunistic threat actors are increasingly targeting the cloud control plane. Many of these threat actors have adopted and employed techniques similar to those previously used by SCATTERED SPIDER, including moving laterally to cloud-hosted virtual machines (VMs) via management tools. The tactics observed in these intrusions varied significantly; some threat actors opportunistically queried the cloud control plane after host-based exploitation, and others specifically targeted cloud environments via access keys with little or no host-based interaction.
