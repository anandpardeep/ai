# CROWDSTRIKE 2025 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT

Disclosing a vulnerability, particularly one acknowledged as exploited in the wild, highlights potentially viable mechanisms for future exploitation. For example, in September 2024, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed multiple POST requests consistent with exploiting a direct request vulnerability in Apache OFBiz (CVE-2024-45195). These POST requests mirrored CVE-2024-45195 exploitation guidance that a well-known industry source had published two weeks earlier. CVE-2024-45195 results from the option to desynchronize the `requestUri` and `overrideViewUri` variables in the `RequestHandler` component of the OFBiz Java application logic.

CVE-2024-45195 is similar to earlier vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-32113, CVE-2024-36104, and CVE-2024-38856) that also exploited desynchronization capabilities to allow unauthorized users to bypass authentication mechanisms. Though the vendor has provided multiple patches and several industry sources have publicly discussed these vulnerabilities, the core flaw persists and allows attackers to manipulate the controller-view state.

Separately, in January 2024, CrowdStrike Intelligence assessed threat actors had almost certainly leveraged CVE-2023-29324 in recent spear-phishing operations. CVE-2023-29324 bypasses Microsoftâ€™s mitigations for a previously disclosed Microsoft Outlook vulnerability (CVE-2023-23397), which **FANCY BEAR** has very likely exploited since at least March 2022 to target organizations in multiple regions and sectors. The same researcher that discovered the initial bypass (CVE-2023-29324) later found another bypass (CVE-2023-35384).

An attacker can trigger both bypasses by inserting a Universal Naming Convention path into either a Server Message Block (TCP 445) or WebDAV share on an attacker-controlled server into the MAPI property named `PidLidReminderFileParameter` (Figure 18).
