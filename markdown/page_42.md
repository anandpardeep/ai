# CROWDSTRIKE 2025 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT

Given that malicious access to SaaS applications typically begins with an identity compromise, relevant campaigns are best mitigated by hardening accounts with MFA. To minimize the risk of adversaries such as SCATTERED SPIDER manipulating MFA, organizations should consider using number matching or hardware-based FIDO2 devices, such as YubiKeys. Moreover, organizations should enforce MFA policies with secure verification methods across all accounts and regularly review any trusted zones or restriction exceptions to avoid unfettered access scenarios.
