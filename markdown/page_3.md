# CROWDSTRIKE 2025 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT

The purpose of this report is to arm you, the world’s security professionals and dedicated cyber defenders, with the knowledge you need to keep a step ahead of these threat actors — and to never, ever underestimate them.

**Here are a few key facts you should know about the shifting threat landscape:**

- **Breakout time** — how long it takes for an adversary to start moving laterally across your network — reached an all-time low in the past year: The average fell to **48 minutes**, and the fastest breakout time we observed dropped to a mere **51 seconds**.
- **Voice phishing (vishing) attacks**, where adversaries call victims to amplify their activities with persuasive social engineering techniques, saw explosive growth — up **442%** between the first and second half of 2024.
- **Attacks related to initial access** boomed, accounting for **52%** of vulnerabilities observed by CrowdStrike in 2024. Providing access as a service became a thriving business, as advertisements for access brokers increased **50% year-over-year**.
- Among nation-states, **China-nexus activity surged 150%** overall, with some targeted industries suffering **200% to 300%** more attacks than the previous year.
- **GenAI** played a pivotal role in sophisticated cyberattack campaigns in 2024. It enabled **FAMOUS CHOLLIMA** to create highly convincing fake IT job candidates that infiltrated victim organizations, and it helped China-, Russia-, and Iran-affiliated threat actors conduct AI-driven disinformation and influence operations to disrupt elections.

As with every product and service we provide, we hope this year’s Global Threat Report makes you more aware, more attuned to the threats you may be facing now or in the near future, and better equipped overall to defend your organization.

CrowdStrike remains at your service and wholly dedicated to the single-minded vision and mission on which the company was founded more than a decade ago. Our company, our platform, and our people are focused on one thing: **working together in close partnership with our customers to stop breaches.**
