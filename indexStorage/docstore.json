A poorly chosen password may result in the\ncompromise of the Council's entire corporate network. As such, all Derbyshire\nCounty Council employees, elected members, partner agencies, contractors,\nvolunteers and vendors with access to Council systems are responsible for taking the\nappropriate steps, as outlined below, to select, use and secure their passwords.\n3 Purpose\nThe purpose of this policy is to establish a standard for the creation of strong\npasswords, the protection of those passwords and the frequency of change across all\nInformation and Communication Technologies (ICT) related systems throughout the\nCouncil.\n4 Scope\nThis policy applies to all employees, elected members, contractors, volunteers,\nvendors, agency staff and partner agencies who:\n\u2022 have or are responsible for any network account or resources (or any form of\naccess that supports or requires a password) on any system that resides at\nany Council facility.\n\u2022 have access to the Council\u2019s data network.\n\u2022 store any personal, sensitive or confidential Council information.\n5 Policy Statement\nThe continual reliance on IT systems, requires that effective password controls are in\nplace to ensure that the integrity of all system/access logon accounts used across\nthe Council is maintained. The following procedures and practices must be followed\nto ensure the security and integrity of these accounts.\n\u2022 All users must ensure that their password is not divulged or shared with\nanyone else.\n\u2022 All users must not create passwords that fall into the category of weak\npasswords under the construction guidelines.\n\u2022 All users must not write down and store passwords.\n\u2022 Passwords must not be inserted into email messages or other forms of\nelectronic communication with the exception of some systems/processes\nwhich may require automatically generated temporary passwords to be sent.\nTemporary passwords must be changed as soon as possible.\n\u2022 All ICT devices which may require local logon privileges for configuration and\nmaintenance i.e. Printers, network switches, routers, SAN appliances etc.\nmust all have the built-in default admin (or equivalent) account password\nchanged in line with the guidelines of this policy wherever possible.\nConsideration should be given in the use of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)\nwherever possible or appropriate\n\u2022 All ICT systems should:\no Support individual user authentication \u2013 providing for identification of\nspecific users and not just groups.

Embedded passwords can be used as a\n\u201cback door\u201d to computers and systems and must be prevented.\no Use access control procedures, which apply to both operational and\ntest systems equally.\nThis policy relates to both the internal and external Derbyshire domains to which\nemployees, elected members, contractors, volunteers, vendors and partner agencies\nlogon. Specific configuration of enforced password policies for each domain is as\nfollows:\n5.1 Internal Users\nThe Council\u2019s main network enables user logons and authentication. It is also the\nsecurity boundary for the majority of systems in use and accessed by Council\nemployees, elected members, partner agencies, contractors, volunteers and\nvendors.\nPassword configuration enforced by the default domain group policy for this domain:\n\u2022 Minimum password length 12 characters\n\u2022 Users are prompted to change their password at first logon and 7 days prior\nto the existing one expiring.\n\u2022 Passwords must meet complexity requirements \u2013 this forces the use of\npasswords which must contain at least four of the following five elements:\no Numeric \u2013 (0-9)\no Uppercase \u2013 (A-Z)\no Lowercase \u2013 (a-z)\no Special Characters (?,!, @, #, %, etc\u2026)\no Spaces\n5.2 External users\nThis area services external (3rd party) connections to the Council\u2019s network and\nfacilitates external user logons and authentication. It is the security boundary placed\nbetween the Internet and the Council\u2019s internal network. This domain boundary is\nused to contain user account logons for various parties including software support\nand interim access.\nPassword configuration enforced by the default domain group policy for this domain:\n\u2022 Minimum password length 12 characters\n\u2022 Password must meet complexity requirements \u2013 detailed as above 5.1\nAll externally procured software must satisfy the requirement of this policy.

This\nobligation also extends to any external organisation contracted to support or access\nthe Information Systems of the Council.\nIn the case of third party vendors, consultants or contractors, non-compliance could\nresult in the immediate removal of access to the system. If damage or compromise of\nthe Council\u2019s ICT systems or network results from the non-compliance, the Council\nwill consider legal action against the third party. The Council will take appropriate\nmeasures to remedy any breach of the policy through the relevant frameworks in\nplace. In the case of an individual the matter may be dealt with under the disciplinary\nprocess.\n9 General Password Construction Guidelines\nPasswords are used for various purposes at Derbyshire County Council. Examples of\nsome of the more common uses include: user level accounts, web accounts, email\naccounts, local access to ICT devices such as routers, printers etc. All staff should be\naware of how to construct and select strong passwords.\nStrong passwords have the following characteristics:\n\u2022 Contain both upper and lower case characters (e.g., a-z, A-Z)\n\u2022 Have digits, punctuation and special characters as well as letters e.g., 0-9,\n!@#$%^&*()_+|~-=\\`{}[]:\";'<>?,./)\n\u2022 Are at least ten alphanumeric characters long.\n\u2022 Are not a word in any language, slang, dialect, jargon, etc.\n\u2022 Are not based on personal information, names of family, etc. \nCONTROLLED\nV15.0 Derbyshire County Council Password Policy\n6\n\u2022 Passwords should never be written down or stored online. Try to create\npasswords that can be easily remembered.\nPoor, weak passwords have the following characteristics and must not be used:\n\u2022 The password contains less than twelve characters and doesn\u2019t include any\nspecial characters or numbers\n\u2022 The password is a word found in a dictionary (English or foreign)\n\u2022 The password is a common usage word such as:\no Names of family, pets, friends, co-workers, fantasy characters, etc.\no Computer terms and names, commands, sites, companies, hardware,\nsoftware.\no Birthdays and other personal information such as addresses and\nphone numbers.\no Repetition such as mmmmmmmm1\no Hashtags and profile names ie anything in the public domain\no Common passphrases found on the internet such as nursery rhymes,\nsong names, slogans etc.\no Word or number patterns like aaabbbcc, zyxwvuts, 123321, etc.\no Keyboard sequences like qwerty, asdfghjk , zxcvbnm, etc\no Any of the above spelled backwards.\no Any of the above preceded or followed by a digit (e.g., secret1,\n1secret)\nCreating Passwords using Passphrases\nUsing passphrases is a good way of constructing strong passwords and helps with\nremembering them.

Passwords constructed in this way, will typically consist of\nletters, numbers and special characters which are used to represent the words or\nmeaning of a phrase. The following example describes this process:\nExample\nStep 1 \u2013 Choose a phrase \u2013 for example: \u2018I catch the number 14 bus on Fridays\u2019\nStep 2 \u2013 Use the first character of each word: I c t n 14 b o f\nStep 3 \u2013 Mix with lower and uppercase letters: iCTn14bOf\nStep 4 \u2013 Incorporate special characters (such as !@#$%^&*()_+|~-=\\`{}[]:\";'<>?,./ )\nand numbers to increase complexity. Using this method, the final password could be:\ni*CTn#14bOf5\nN.B. Incorporate special characters and numbers into your password in a way which\nhelps you to remember where they should be e.g. could be after every 2nd, 4th, or 5th\nletter \u2013 or a similar \u2018system\u2019 which is meaningful to you.\nBasically, the more letters, special characters and numbers used and the longer the\npassword containing these is, the stronger the password will be.\nIMPORTANT: The above passphrase/password is an example and must NOT be\nused.\nPassword Protection Standards\nCONTROLLED\nV15.0 Derbyshire County Council Password Policy\n7\n\u2022 Do not use the same password you use for Council accounts as for other\nnon-Council access (e.g., personal ISP account, personal banking, online\nshopping etc.).\n\u2022 Do not share Council passwords with anyone, including administrative\nassistants or secretaries.
