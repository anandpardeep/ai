# Recommendations

## Secure the entire identity ecosystem

Adversaries increasingly target identities using credential theft, MFA bypass, and social engineering while covertly moving laterally between on-premises, cloud, and SaaS environments via trusted relationships. This allows them to impersonate legitimate users, escalate access, and evade detection.

Organizations should adopt phishing-resistant MFA solutions, such as hardware security keys, to prevent unauthorized access. Strong identity and access policies are essential, including just-in-time access, regular account reviews, and conditional access controls. Identity threat detection tools must monitor behavior across endpoints and on-premises, cloud, and SaaS environments to flag privilege escalation, unauthorized access, or backdoor account creation. Integrating these tools with XDR platforms ensures comprehensive visibility and unified defense against adversaries.

Additionally, organizations should educate users to recognize vishing and phishing attempts while maintaining proactive monitoring to detect and respond to identity-based threats.

## Eliminate cross-domain visibility gaps

Adversaries use hands-on-keyboard techniques and legitimate tools to make detection and response more difficult. Unlike traditional malware, these methods allow attackers to bypass traditional security measures by executing commands and using legitimate software to mimic normal operations.

To counter this, organizations must modernize their detection and response strategies. XDR and next-generation security information and event management (SIEM) solutions provide unified visibility across endpoints, networks, cloud environments, and identity systems, enabling analysts to correlate suspicious behavior and see the full attack path.

Proactive threat hunting and threat intelligence further enhance detection by identifying potential attack patterns and providing insights into adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures. With real-time intelligence, organizations can stay informed about emerging threats, anticipate attacks, and prioritize critical security efforts.

## Defend the cloud as core infrastructure

Cloud-focused adversaries exploit misconfigurations, stolen credentials, and cloud management tools to infiltrate systems, move laterally, and maintain persistent access for malicious activities like data theft and ransomware deployment.

Cloud-native application protection platforms (CNAPPs) with cloud detection and response (CDR) capabilities are critical to countering these threats. CNAPPs provide comprehensive visibility into cloud environments, detect and respond to threats in real-time, and enable organizations to maintain control over their cloud infrastructure.

By implementing these recommendations, organizations can strengthen their defenses against identity-based threats, eliminate cross-domain visibility gaps, and defend their cloud infrastructure as core infrastructure.
