### General Secretary Xi Jinping's 2014 call for China to become a cyber power

*   **CCP’s grand strategy of national rejuvenation** has accelerated the sophistication of China's cyber capabilities throughout the first quarter of the 21st century.
*   **Decades of cyber program investments** include:
    *   Expanding CCP oversight of information networks in China through a broad cybersecurity legal framework
    *   CCP investment in university systems that produce highly trained and readily available cyber workforce
    *   Private sector contracting pipelines that provide skilled support and infrastructure to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), Ministry of Public Security (MPS), and Ministry of State Security (MSS) cyber units
    *   Vulnerability discovery, bug hunt, and domestic capture-the-flag competitions that foster Chinese cyber talent and feed CCP-controlled exploit development programs
    *   Industry networking through MSS and PLA cyber operators increasingly sharing unique closed-access tooling and tradecraft

### China’s Maturing Cyber Ecosystem

Highly likely as a result of these investments, China-nexus targeted intrusion operations are marked by increased OPSEC and specialization. Adversaries are pre-positioning themselves into critical networks and are supported by industry networking and larger ecosystems, which include shared tooling and training pipelines supplying them with sophisticated malware and tradecraft.
