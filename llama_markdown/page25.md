**GenAI Outlook**

More adversaries will likely use genAI to augment social engineering and CNO campaigns in 2025. This assessment is made with moderate confidence based on the growing availability and capability of genAI tools and adversaries' increased experience with integrating them. CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses that more technically capable threat actors will be best equipped to employ genAI tools, while less sophisticated threat actors will likely not fully exploit their capabilities.

**China's Cyber Enterprise**

**China's Maturing Cyber Capabilities**

China's cyber espionage and intelligence collection capabilities reached an inflection point in 2024 relative to previous years. In addition to prolific and high-profile cyber espionage activities—which continued to increase across almost every sector that CrowdStrike Intelligence tracks—China-nexus adversaries and the larger ecosystem supporting their operations have matured in capability and capacity.

Throughout 2024, China-nexus adversaries' advancements manifested through increasingly bold targeting, stealthier tactics, and specialized operations. The underlying motivation is likely China's desire for regional influence in the nation's near abroad. This includes a desire for the eventual reunification of Taiwan, which may ultimately bring China into conflict with the United States.

In addition to facilitating intelligence collection against foreign political and military entities, these operations likely fulfill general intelligence requirements in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)'s strategic plans. This includes the 14th Five-Year Plan, which highlights key sectors and technology priorities. China-nexus adversaries also conduct intelligence collection against social and political movements perceived as domestic security threats in China. The CCP collectively refers to Falun Gong practitioners, Chinese democracy activists, Uyghur separatists, Tibetan separatists, and Taiwanese separatists as the "Five Poisons" and views these groups as a threat to its legitimacy and China's overall stability.

**Cyber Power**

China's goal of becoming a cyber power includes developing technical world-class and innovative cybersecurity skills as well as expanding state oversight of information networks via methods such as laws and regulations.

**National Rejuvenation**

The aim of national rejuvenation, the CCP's grand strategy, is to modernize and transform China into a global power by ensuring the CCP remains in power, guaranteeing a strong economy, and securing China's ability to pursue its ambitions free from foreign interference.

**The CCP's Grand Strategy of National Rejuvenation**

| **Goal** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Modernize and Transform China | Become a global power |
| Ensure CCP Remains in Power | Guarantee a strong economy |
| Secure China's Ability to Pursue Ambitions | Free from foreign interference |

**China's Cyber Enterprise: A Growing Threat**

China's cyber enterprise is a growing threat to global security. With its advanced capabilities and increasing sophistication, China is well-positioned to continue to expand its cyber operations and pose a significant challenge to its adversaries.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, China's cyber enterprise is a significant threat to global security. Its advanced capabilities and increasing sophistication make it a formidable opponent in the cyber domain. As China continues to expand its cyber operations, it is likely to pose a growing challenge to its adversaries.
