### Don't Underestimate Today's Enterprising Adversaries

Watch any nature program, and you'll quickly discover what happens to animals that underestimate their adversaries. They become prey. The same principle applies in cybersecurity - the adversary is advancing so fast that you can't afford to underestimate them.

Our latest research demonstrates that adversaries are becoming more efficient, focused, and businesslike in their approach - in many ways, more like the enterprise organizations they prey upon. That's why our team of security analysts, experts, and authors chose "the enterprising adversary" as the theme for this year's CrowdStrike Global Threat Report.

Take generative artificial intelligence (genAI), for instance. Highly effective adversaries across all major categories - nation-state, eCrime, and hacktivist - have become early and avid adopters. The "force multiplier" impact of off-the-shelf chatbots has made genAI a popular addition to the global hacker toolbox.

Along with legitimate organizations, easy access to commercial large language models (LLMs) is making adversaries more productive, too. It's shortening their learning curve and development cycles, allowing them to increase the scale and pace of their activities. Though this report indicates that malicious use of AI is growing, it remains largely iterative and evolutionary at this point in time. Only occasionally does it manifest as an entirely novel use case. But it is still early days.

At CrowdStrike, we aren't waiting for threat actors to experience their next "aha" moment. We are accelerating our own use of AI techniques - from our foundational machine learning capabilities to our leading-edge generative and agentic AI models - to help our customers anticipate the next zero-day attacks in advance and proactively inoculate themselves against them. This is the essence of an AI-native approach to cybersecurity. Unlike legacy systems, which are still reliant on organizations globally, we don't sit idle until an attack occurs before we can identify and stop it.

**Adversarial Enterprise Takes Its Toll**

The job of protecting your organization continues to get harder by the day. You'll find ample evidence of this fact in the data that follows. The number of new "named adversaries" tracked by the elite CrowdStrike Counter Adversary Operations team continues to expand, and established adversaries are constantly adding new targets and more sophisticated techniques to their evasion, intrusion, and exfiltration arsenals.
