**Specialized China-Nexus Adversaries**

CrowdStrike Intelligence identified seven new targeted intrusion adversaries originating from China in 2024, five of which are unique in their specialization and sophistication. These adversaries are:

*   **LIMINAL PANDA**
*   **LOCKSMITH PANDA**
*   **OPERATOR PANDA**

These high-capability adversaries have unique telecom network targeting remits and toolsets.

**Adversary Profiles**

| Adversary | Description |
| --- | --- |
| LIMINAL PANDA | Demonstrates extensive knowledge of telecommunications networks and uses compromised telecom infrastructure to move across regions. |
| LOCKSMITH PANDA | Targets technology, gaming, energy, and telecommunications entities in Taiwan and Indonesia, as well as Hong Kong democracy activists, likely intended to facilitate intelligence collection. |
| OPERATOR PANDA | Relies heavily on exploiting internet-facing appliances, such as Cisco switches, for initial access. |
| VAULT PANDA | Exploits web-facing applications to achieve initial access to victim networks and uses a combination of unique, shared, and publicly available tools in their intrusions, targeting financial services, gambling, technology, academic, defense, and government entities likely to facilitate intelligence collection operations. |
| ENVOY PANDA | Targets Africa- and Middle East-based government entities, particularly in the diplomatic space, and increasingly uses anonymization attempts in operations. |

These adversaries pose a significant threat to organizations in various industries, and it is essential to be aware of their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to defend against their attacks.
