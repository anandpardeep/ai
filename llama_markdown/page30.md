# Cloud-Conscious China-Nexus Actors

China-nexus actors developed cloud-conscious techniques throughout 2024 and are increasingly targeting and abusing cloud environments for data collection. The increase in unattributed cloud intrusions corresponds with an incremental increase in suspected China-nexus incidents overall. Suspected China-nexus cloud intrusions increased 6% in 2024 across multiple cloud services, including Alibaba and Azure.

# Cloud-Conscious DPRK-Nexus Actors

DPRK-nexus adversary LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA consistently targeted cloud environments, compromising developer workstations via backdoored GitHub projects before pivoting to the cloud by using cached credentials. FAMOUS CHOLLIMA also emerged as a cloud-conscious adversary in 2024, frequently gaining access to cloud environments as an insider threat and then establishing persistence via a backdoor administrator user.

# Access to Valid Accounts Facilitates Initial Access Techniques

Abusing valid accounts has become the primary initial access vector to the cloud, accounting for 35% of cloud incidents in the first half of 2024. Attackers are increasingly using stealth-oriented tactics and attempting to access credentials to target valid accounts. They do not change the credentials, which would notify the user of illicit access. Emerging threat actors are likely to continue exploring similar methods to access valid cloud accounts, allowing for more reliable access to cloud environments with a lower detection risk.

In 2023, threat actors commonly obtained cloud credentials via unsecured sources such as the cloud VM Instance Metadata Service, IT development services, or secured password storage solutions. Though this trend continued into 2024, threat actors also began to explore other mechanisms to access valid accounts via credentials and trust relationships.

One likely initial access mechanism is leveraging information stealers; during 2024, threat actors updated Stealc and Vidar to target cloud accounts. These stealers provide attackers with instant access to cloud credentials and email lists that can be leveraged for password spraying and phishing.

Another method for credential collection involves abusing trust relationships to gain access to cloud accounts. More adversaries used connections between business partners and their cloud tenants to access environments without needing to obtain credentials in the victim tenant. FAMOUS CHOLLIMA capitalized on another form of trusted relationships as an insider threat to deploy a backdoor in a cloud tenant after one of their operators was hired at the target organization. This adversary is particularly concerning because their operators are often hired in developer positions and given access to cloud accounts.
