**Key Adversary Themes**

**THE BUSINESS OF SOCIAL ENGINEERING**

Since 2023, eCrime and targeted intrusion adversaries have increasingly used identity compromise and other human-centric tradecraft to gain initial access and perform lateral movement. The emergence of this tactic is partly driven by the growing efficacy and abundance of modern host-based security tools such as endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions. These factors have driven social engineering activity in which threat actors attempt to access targeted accounts or persuade legitimate employees to provide remote access to targeted systems.

In 2024, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed a massive increase in the number of distinct campaigns using telephone-oriented social engineering techniques to gain initial access, including vishing and help desk social engineering, marking a potential shift in the eCrime ecosystem.

**2024 Vishing Trends**

Several eCrime adversaries incorporated vishing into their intrusions in 2024, amounting to a 40% compounded monthly growth rate in observed vishing operations for the year. The latter half of 2024 saw a significant increase in the use of this tactic.

**Why Vishing is So Effective**

Similar to other social engineering techniques, vishing is effective because it targets human weakness or error rather than a flaw in software or an operating system. Malicious activity may not be detected until later in an intrusion, such as during malicious binary execution or hands-on-keyboard activity, which can delay an effective response. This gives the threat actor an advantage and puts the onus on users to recognize potentially malicious behavior.
