# Threat Landscape Overview

Cyberattacks are escalating in speed, volume, and sophistication. As organizations work to strengthen their defenses, adversaries target their weaknesses: employees susceptible to social engineering and systems lacking modern security controls. Once inside, they act within seconds, stealthily moving across networks to execute attacks. In 2024, 79% of the detections CrowdStrike observed were malware-free, indicating adversaries are using hands-on-keyboard techniques that blend in with legitimate user activity and impede detection.
