**Generative Artificial Intelligence and the Enterprising Adversary**

GenAI has emerged as an attractive tool for adversaries, offering a low barrier to entry that makes it widely accessible. Recent advancements in genAI have enhanced the efficacy of certain cyber operations, particularly those utilizing social engineering. It is almost certain that genAI will be employed in 2025 cyber operations.

**Adversaries' Adoption of GenAI**

Adversaries increasingly adopted genAI throughout 2024, particularly in support of social engineering efforts and high-tempo IO campaigns. Both were supported by genAI tools that can create highly convincing outputs without precise prompting, custom model training, or fine-tuning. Some threat actors are employing genAI, specifically LLMs, to support CNO efforts.

**Social Engineering**

*   **FAMOUS CHOLLIMA**: Employed fictitious LinkedIn profiles with genAI-created text and fake profile images.
*   **Deepfake Video and Voice Clones**: Enabled business email compromise (BEC) schemes.
*   **Studies**: Validated the effectiveness of genAI in phishing.
*   **China-Aligned LLM-Powered Green Cicada Network**: Posted coordinated inauthentic behavior on social media.
*   **Russia-Aligned Operators**: Used LLMs to spread disinformation on social media.
*   **GenAI**: Used during the Indian election season to create videos and images.

**Malicious Computer Network Operations**

*   **Spam Email Campaign**: Distributed Snake Keylogger likely used LLM-generated content.
*   **Big Game Hunting (BGH) Ransomware Operators**: Deployed likely LLM-authored data destruction script.
*   **Likely LLM-Generated Decoy Sites**: Used in NITRO SPIDER campaigns.
*   **Actors on Criminal Forums**: Discussed using LLMs for coding and shell commands.
*   **LLM**: Likely used to develop an alleged exploit for CVE-2024-3400.
*   **Cloud-Conscious Operators**: Attempted to gain access to enterprise LLMs.
