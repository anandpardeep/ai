**Common Attack Paths and Tactics in Cloud Intrusions**

### Common Attack Paths and Tactics

| **Attack Path** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Initial Access | The initial entry point into a cloud environment, often through phishing, exploitation of vulnerabilities, or misuse of credentials. |
| Persistence | Techniques used to maintain access to the cloud environment over time, such as creating backdoors or using persistence mechanisms. |
| Privilege Escalation | Methods used to gain higher levels of access or privileges within the cloud environment, potentially leading to more significant impacts. |
| Defense Evasion | Tactics employed to avoid detection by security controls, including encryption, obfuscation, and anti-forensic techniques. |
| Discovery | Actions taken to gather information about the cloud environment, such as network scanning, service discovery, and data collection. |
| Collection | The process of gathering data of interest from the cloud environment, which could include sensitive information or intellectual property. |
| Impact | The final stage where the attacker achieves their objectives, which could range from data theft to disrupting operations. |

### Cloud-Specific Threats

| **Threat** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Misconfigured Resources | Incorrectly configured cloud resources that can be exploited by attackers. |
| Unsecured Data | Sensitive data not properly encrypted or protected in the cloud. |
| Inadequate Identity and Access Management (IAM) | Weaknesses in IAM policies or implementations that allow unauthorized access. |
| Insufficient Monitoring and Logging | Lack of visibility into cloud activities, making it difficult to detect and respond to security incidents. |
| Unpatched Vulnerabilities | Failure to apply security patches to cloud services or applications, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation. |

### Best Practices for Cloud Security

| **Best Practice** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Implement Strong IAM Policies | Ensure that IAM policies are robust and regularly reviewed. |
| Use Encryption | Encrypt data both in transit and at rest. |
| Monitor and Log Cloud Activities | Regularly monitor and analyze cloud logs to detect potential security incidents. |
| Keep Cloud Services Up-to-Date | Regularly update cloud services and applications with the latest security patches. |
| Conduct Regular Security Audits | Perform regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities. |

By understanding these common attack paths, tactics, and cloud-specific threats, organizations can better protect their cloud environments and data. Implementing best practices for cloud security is crucial for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of cloud resources.
