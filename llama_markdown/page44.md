# CrowdStrike 2025 Global Threat Report

## Threat Landscape

The vulnerability exploitation landscape remains a critical concern. Threat actors are expected to continue aggressively targeting devices at the network periphery, particularly network appliances. End-of-life (EOL) product exploitation is almost certain to continue or grow in 2025. In their continued pursuit to discover new vulnerabilities or abuse legitimate product features, adversaries will likely leverage technical blogs and operationalize public POC exploits faster than in previous years.

### SaaS Applications

SaaS applications are also an area of concern. After observing several eCrime and targeted intrusion adversaries using access to cloud-based SaaS applications to obtain data for lateral movement, extortion, and third-party targeting in 2024, CrowdStrike also anticipates SaaS exploitation will be a threat to watch in 2025.

### Cloud Environments

Additionally, 2024 brought the emergence of threat actors who exclusively target cloud environments with unique, cloud-specific skill sets. Adversaries strengthened their emphasis on defense evasion in cloud environments, adopting stealth-oriented tactics and tools for initial access and credential access. This focus is expected to intensify in 2025.

### Enterprise Adversaries

Throughout 2024, enterprise adversaries expanded the maturity and sophistication of their operations across sectors and geographies. As these threats evolve in 2025, the CrowdStrike Counter Adversary Operations team remains committed to identifying, tracking, and disrupting threat actors whenever and wherever possible.
