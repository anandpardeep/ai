CROWDSTRIKE 
2025 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT

GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

AND THE ENTERPRISING ADVERSARY

GenAI has emerged as an attractive tool for adversaries with a low barrier to entry that makes it widely accessible.

Recent advancements in genAI have enhanced the efficacy of certain cyber operations, particularly those using

social engineering. It will almost certainly be employed in 2025 cyber operations.

Adversaries increasingly adopted genAI throughout 2024, particularly in support of social engineering efforts and

high-tempo IO campaigns. Both were supported by genAI tools that can create highly convincing outputs without

precise prompting, custom model training, or fine-tuning. Some threat actors are employing genAI, specifically LLMs,

to support CNO efforts.

Figure 8. Adversaries leveraging LLMs for social engineering and malicious CNO

•	 FAMOUS CHOLLIMA employed fictitious

LinkedIn profiles with genAI-created text

and fake profile images

•	 Deepfake video and voice clones enabled

business email compromise (BEC) schemes

•	 Studies validated effectiveness of genAI

in phishing

•	 China-aligned, LLM-powered Green Cicada

network posted coordinated inauthentic

behavior on social media

•	 Russia-aligned operators used LLMs to

spread disinformation on social media

•	 GenAI was used during Indian election

season to create videos and images

•	 Spam email campaign distributing Snake

Keylogger likely used LLM-generated

content

•	 Big game hunting (BGH) ransomware

operators APT INC deployed likely

LLM-authored data destruction script

•	 Likely LLM-generated decoy sites used in

NITRO SPIDER campaigns

•	 Actors on criminal forms discussed using

LLMs for coding and shell commands

•	 LLM was likely used to develop an alleged

exploit for CVE-2024-3400

•	 Cloud-conscious operators attempted to

gain access to enterprise LLMs
